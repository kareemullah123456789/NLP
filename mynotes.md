Key Takeaways

Static vs Contextual: Traditional embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) provide static representations, while modern approaches (BERT, ELMo) provide context-dependent representations.
Subword Information: FastText's approach to handling out-of-vocabulary words through subword information is crucial for morphologically rich languages.
Evaluation: Multiple evaluation methods (intrinsic and extrinsic) are needed to properly assess embedding quality.
Scalability: Different approaches have different computational requirements and scalability characteristics.
Domain Adaptation: Embeddings trained on general corpora may need fine-tuning for specific domains.
